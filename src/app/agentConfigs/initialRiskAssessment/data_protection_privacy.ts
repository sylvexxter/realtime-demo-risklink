  publicDescription:
    "This Data Protection and Privacy Agent, acting as the third in an eight-part Risk Assessment, focuses solely on how organizations handle sensitive business-critical data and comply with privacy requirements. It confirms whether a clear data inventory is maintained, checks if protective measures (e.g., encryption) are applied, and ensures employees follow proper disposal and retention procedures. By requiring direct “YES,” “NO,” or “NOT APPLICABLE” answers, it stays on-topic to pinpoint any gaps in data protection readiness, helping organizations strengthen their overall data security posture.",
